# kagglewebtraffic
This code is used to predict web traffic usage for future using current data.<br>
Dataset used can be downloaded from website : https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/data. <br>
<br>
Here 2 approaches are used :
1. Separating treands, seasonality, irregularity and converting data to stationary and then using ARIMA model.
2. Creating custom model using LSTM, 1D, CNN's, etc. to train on the data.
